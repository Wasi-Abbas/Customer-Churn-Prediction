# Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction using Keras Sequential Model

### Description:
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a business using a Keras sequential model. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a service or product. By analyzing historical customer data, such as usage patterns, interactions, and demographics, a predictive model is developed using the Keras library's sequential architecture.

### Key Components:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Historical customer data is collected and preprocessed to create a structured dataset. Features such as customer demographics, usage frequency, engagement metrics, and service-related information are extracted.

Model Architecture: A Keras sequential model is designed to process the input features and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The model comprises multiple layers of artificial neurons, including dense layers for feature extraction and a final output layer for prediction.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features are selected, and preprocessing steps such as normalization, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing data are performed to prepare the data for training.

Training: The model is trained using historical data with labeled churn outcomes. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and correlations between input features and churn events.

Validation and Testing: The trained model is validated using a separate validation dataset to ensure it generalizes well. Testing is done on unseen data to assess the model's performance in predicting customer churn.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers or neurons are tuned to optimize the model's performance.

Evaluation and Metrics: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves are used to evaluate the model's ability to predict customer churn accurately.

Deployment and Actionable Insights: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed to predict customer churn in real-time. The project provides actionable insights for businesses to proactively address potential churn cases and implement retention strategies.

### Outcome:
By the end of the project, a trained Keras sequential model is developed that predicts customer churn based on input features. The project demonstrates the power of deep learning in customer behavior analysis and enables businesses to take informed actions to retain customers.
